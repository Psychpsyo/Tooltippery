# Tooltippery

This is a mod for NeosVR that enables the functionality to show hober tooltips on UI elements.  
By default, the mod doesn't add any specific tooltips on its own but other players can set their items up in a way where they get tooltips by default.

## Adding Tooltips

### For Builders

To add a tooltip to a UIX Button, simply put a Comment component (Uncategorized -> Comment) on the same slot as the Button component and set its Text to "TooltipperyLabel:Example Text", where Example Text would be replaced with what you want it to show on the tooltip.
